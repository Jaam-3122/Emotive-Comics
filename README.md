# Emotive-Comics
This is a project I had done to create a Comic Panel on giving the input as text or as audio. If the input is audio then, the speech to text conversion takes place.The image generation takes place by using the Stable Diffusion model 1.0 Base+ refiner. This is currently being running locally. If hosted in cloud or related the generation time would be less than a minute. This model also has an integration with ControlNet for pose consistency. The higher GPU we used to run this was RTX 3050. Instead of speech bubble we had given narrative bubble which was given bases on Rule- Based approach.

These are the sample outputs of my model. Working on it to implement more features into it and will try to increase in the people who are fed up with the traditional method of story telling.
